    <p>Custom sign comissoned for the door into the Elko engineering garage at the University of Alberta</p>
    <p>This cutom sign was comissioned by the Elko engineering garage for their side door to the adjoining facility. The fonts and colours were designed in accordnce with the style guide of the organization. Original spec from the client was very broad to just incorporate the logo and fit above the door. Consultation on design choices were made throughout the eraly stages of computer design.</p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images/making gallery/Elko_sign.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1">Logo scale as well as font and spacing were determined and layed out in CAD, pieces were then cut CNC routered out of an MDF sheet.</p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images/making gallery/Elko_sign/All_routed_wood.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1"> After routering, the individual pieces were sealed with PVA glue then sanded and painted to match organization colours.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para1">After Painting acrylic pannels were laser-cut to match the logo and pressed in place, these were desgined to be removeable so lights could be added later.</p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images/making gallery/Elko_sign/Sign_with_acrylic.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1">A large backing plate was created and a cardbaord alignment tool was laser cut, this was used to space the letters, the larger letters were nailed and glued down with small backing blocks, again to allow for the installation of lights.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para1">Once the letters were set, small holes were drilled behind the letters and inside the logo to run wires from an LED driver. LED strips were affixed behind the letters and inside the logo to obtain the desired lighting effect. </p>
