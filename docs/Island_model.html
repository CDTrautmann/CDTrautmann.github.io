    <h2 class="mb-4">Vancouver Island Model </h2>
    <p>A detailed model of both the bathymetry and topography on and around Vancouver island.</p>
    <p>Laser Cut Birch plywood was stained and laser cut then glued together to create the ocean depth map,  3D printed model was painted and attacehd to create the terrain of the island, The complete model was then enclosed with a walnut frame and given mounting hardware.</p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images\making gallery/VI_model.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1"> Based on bathymetry data made vailble by the goverenment of canada lines of approximamtely equal spacing were traced into a .svg file by copying the map from Qgis into inkscape for processing</p>
    <p class="para1"> This data was then processed into a laser cutter and used to create carboard tests </p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images/making gallery/VI_model/Cardboard_1.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1">An extrction of the candaian DEM of the island was taken from the goverenment website HERE and then processed in QGIS using the DEM to .stl extension LINK, this stl was then cut and SLA printed</p>
    <p class="para1"> At this point it became clear that the map I was using for the bathymetry data was in  differnet projection than the DEM so I used Qgis to re-project the bathymetry data and re-processed the .svg</p>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="images/making gallery/VI_model/Cardboard_print_1.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para1"> The updated version was compared to the 3D prints and  first pinting test was performed on that model, the paint was effective and the projections matched so I proceeded to the wood model.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para1">After Painting acrylic pannels were laser-cut to match the logo and pressed in place, these were desgined to be removeable so lights could be added later.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para1">A large backing plate was created and a cardbaord alignment tool was laser cut, this was used to space the letters, the larger letters were nailed and glued down with small backing blocks, again to allow for the installation of lights.</p>

    <p class="para1">Once the letters were set, small holes were drilled behind the letters and inside the logo to run wires from an LED driver. LED strips were affixed behind the letters and inside the logo to obtain the desired lighting effect. </p>
